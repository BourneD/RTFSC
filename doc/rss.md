# Resident set size

> resident set size (RSS) is the portion of memory occupied by a process that is held in main memory (RAM). The rest of the occupied memory exists in the swap space or file system, either because some parts of the occupied memory were paged out, or because some parts of the executable were never loaded.[1][2]
